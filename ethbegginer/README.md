## Description

asaCoin is a Solidity contract for a token on the Ethereum blockchain.

The contract includes public variables that store the details about the token, such as its name, abbreviation, and total supply. 

It also has a mapping of addresses to balances, which keeps track of how many tokens each address holds.

## Getting Started

To get started with asaCoin, you will need to have a basic understanding of the Solidity programming language and the Ethereum blockchain. 

You will also need to have a development environment set up with the necessary tools and dependencies.

## Installing

To install asaCoin, you can clone this repository or copy the contract code into your development environment. 

You will need to have the Solidity compiler installed in order to compile the contract.


## Executing

To execute asaCoin, you can deploy the contract to a local or test Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Remix or Truffle. 

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using its public functions, such as mint and burn.
